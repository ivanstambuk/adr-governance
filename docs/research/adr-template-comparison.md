## 1. Purpose

This document surveys and compares the major Architecture Decision Record (ADR) template formats in use today. The goal is to:

1. Catalogue the **structural sections** of each template
2. Identify **where our `adr-governance` schema** stands relative to the field
3. Produce a **feature comparison matrix**
4. Provide a **synthesis** with recommendations for our schema

## 3. Template-by-Template Analysis

### 3.1 Nygard (2011) — The Original

The foundational ADR format. Intentionally minimal.

**Sections:**

| Section | Required | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Title | ✅ | Short noun phrase |
| Status | ✅ | `proposed`, `accepted`, `deprecated`, `superseded` |
| Context | ✅ | Forces at play — technical, political, social. Value-neutral language |
| Decision | ✅ | "We will…" — active voice, full sentences |
| Consequences | ✅ | What becomes easier or harder. Positive and negative, no sub-structure |

**Characteristics:**
- **5 sections, all required.** No optional sections.
- **No metadata** — no date, no author, no tags, no ID.
- **No alternatives analysis** — only the chosen decision is recorded.
- **Flat consequences** — single narrative block, no structured sub-fields.
- **Design philosophy:** "Short enough to fit on one page." Append-only — never edit, only supersede.
- **Tooling:** `adr-tools` (npryce/adr-tools) provides CLI for file management.

**What it lacks:** Alternatives comparison, risk assessment, author tracking, dates, formal review/approval, compliance implications, deployment planning, monitoring, audit trail.

---

### 3.2 MADR 4.0 (2024) — Markdown Any Decision Record

The most widely adopted structured ADR template. Maintained by the `adr` GitHub organization. Olaf Zimmermann is a contributor.

**Sections:**

| Section | Required | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| YAML Frontmatter | Optional | `status`, `date`, `decision-makers`, `consulted`, `informed` |
| Title (H1) | ✅ | Represents problem + solution |
| Context and Problem Statement | ✅ | Free-form or illustrative story |
| Decision Drivers | Optional | Bullet list of forces/concerns |
| Considered Options | ✅ | List of option titles |
| Decision Outcome | ✅ | Chosen option with `because` justification |
| → Consequences | Optional | `Good, because…` / `Bad, because…` / `Neutral, because…` |
| → Confirmation | Optional | How compliance with the ADR will be verified |
| Pros and Cons of the Options | Optional | Per-option breakdown: Good / Neutral / Bad bullets |
| More Information | Optional | Links, team agreement, realization timeline |

**Characteristics:**
- **~10 sections, 3 required.** Optional metadata in YAML frontmatter.
- **RACI-like stakeholder model** in frontmatter: `decision-makers`, `consulted`, `informed`.
- **Pros/Cons per option** — structured comparison of alternatives.
- **Consequences are labeled** — `Good, because…` / `Bad, because…` — but not sub-categorized (no security/compliance/operational split).
- **Confirmation section** — unique to MADR: "how will we verify this decision was implemented correctly?" (e.g., code review, ArchUnit test).
- **No risk assessment, no deployment plan, no monitoring, no audit trail.**
- **No formal approval workflow** — `decision-makers` is informational only.

---

### 3.3 Structured MADR / smadr (2025) — Machine-Readable Extension

An extension of MADR designed for machine consumption, AI tooling, and compliance auditing.

**Sections:**

| Section | Required | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| YAML Frontmatter | ✅ | `title`, `description`, `type`, `category`, `tags`, `status`, `created`, `updated`, `author`, `project` |
| Optional Frontmatter | — | `technologies`, `audience`, `related` (links to other smadr files) |
| Extension Fields | — | `x-*` prefixed custom metadata |
| Status | ✅ | Markdown body — current decision status |
| Context | ✅ | Background, problem statement, current limitations |
| Decision Drivers | ✅ | Primary and secondary factors |
| Considered Options | ✅ | Per-option: description, characteristics, advantages, disadvantages, **risk assessment** |
| → Risk Assessment (per option) | ✅ | **Technical Risk** (Low/Med/High), **Schedule Risk**, **Ecosystem Risk** |
| Decision | ✅ | Chosen approach with implementation details |
| Consequences | ✅ | Positive, negative, neutral |
| Decision Outcome | ✅ | Summary with mitigations for negative consequences |
| Related Decisions | Optional | Links to related ADRs |
| Links | Optional | External resources |
| More Information | Optional | Date, source, references |
| **Audit** | Optional | **Compliance tracking with findings table** |

**Characteristics:**
- **Most structured of the Markdown-based templates.**
- **JSON Schema for frontmatter validation** — machine-parseable metadata.
- **Three-dimensional risk assessment per option** (Technical, Schedule, Ecosystem) — unique feature.
- **Audit section** for compliance tracking — SOC2, HIPAA, ISO 27001.
- **AI-ready** — explicitly designed for Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor integration.
- **No deployment plan, no monitoring, no SLA, no approval workflow.**
- **No structured security/compliance/operational implications** — these would go in free-text Consequences or Audit.

### 3.4 Tyree–Akerman (2005) — IEEE Enterprise Template

The most comprehensive traditional ADR template. Published in IEEE Software.

**Sections:**

| Section | Required | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Issue | ✅ | Design issue being addressed |
| Decision | ✅ | Chosen direction/position |
| Status | ✅ | `pending`, `decided`, `approved` |
| Group | ✅ | Category (integration, presentation, data, etc.) |
| Assumptions | ✅ | Cost, schedule, technology assumptions |
| Constraints | ✅ | Additional limitations imposed by the decision |
| Positions | ✅ | All viable alternatives with models/diagrams |
| Argument | ✅ | Reasoning for chosen position over alternatives |
| Implications | ✅ | Required follow-ups, new requirements, staff training |
| Related Decisions | ✅ | Links to connected architectural decisions |
| Related Requirements | ✅ | Mapping to business objectives |
| Related Artifacts | ✅ | Architecture/design/scope documents impacted |
| Related Principles | ✅ | Enterprise policies and principles influencing the decision |
| Notes | ✅ | Discussion items and issues raised |

**Characteristics:**
- **14 sections, most required.** The heaviest template.
- **Unique sections:** `Assumptions`, `Constraints`, `Related Principles`, `Related Artifacts`, `Notes`.
- **Enterprise governance-oriented:** explicit links to requirements, principles, and artifacts.
- **No structured consequences** — `Implications` is a single section.
- **No risk assessment, no deployment plan, no monitoring, no audit trail.**
- **No metadata** — no date, author, tags, or ID in the original template.
- **Criticism:** Feels bureaucratic for smaller decisions. 15+ sections is a high bar.

---

### 3.5 Y-Statements (2012) — Ultra-Minimal

A single structured sentence capturing the entire decision.

**Structure:**

```
In the context of {use case},
  facing {non-functional concern},
  we decided for {option}
  and neglected {alternatives},
  to achieve {quality benefit},
  accepting that {tradeoff/downside}
  [because {additional rationale}].
```

**Characteristics:**
- **1 "section" — a single sentence.** The most minimal format.
- **Forces extreme clarity** — you must compress the entire decision into one statement.
- **No metadata, no alternatives analysis, no risk assessment, no consequences breakdown.**
- **Best used as:** A summary or index entry, not as a standalone record.
- **Often combined with other templates** — Y-Statement as the abstract, MADR as the body.

---

### 3.6 Alexandrian (Pattern Language)

Inspired by Christopher Alexander's pattern language.

**Sections:**

| Section | Required | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Prologue (Summary) | ✅ | Brief overview |
| Discussion (Context) | ✅ | Problem, forces, background — written as a narrative |
| Solution (Decision) | ✅ | The architectural response |
| Consequences (Resulting Context) | ✅ | What changes after applying the solution |

**Characteristics:**
- **4 sections.** Narrative style — reads like a design pattern.
- **"Resulting Context"** explicitly frames consequences as the new context for future decisions.
- **Encourages linking** — patterns reference related patterns, forming a language.
- **No metadata, no alternatives, no risk, no approval, no deployment.**
- **Philosophy:** Decisions are patterns; the ADR log is a pattern language.

---

### 3.7 Business Case (Henderson)

Oriented toward management stakeholders and financial justification.

**Sections:**

| Section | Required | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Title | ✅ | Short imperative phrase |
| Status | ✅ | Standard status values |
| Evaluation Criteria | ✅ | What we're evaluating and why |
| Candidates to Consider | ✅ | All options with outlier notes |
| Research and Analysis | ✅ | Per-candidate deep dive |
| → Criteria Assessment | ✅ | Does/doesn't meet criteria and why |
| → Cost Analysis | ✅ | Licensing, training, operating, metering costs |
| → SWOT Analysis | ✅ | Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats per candidate |
| → Internal Opinions | ✅ | Team and stakeholder feedback |
| → External Opinions | Optional | Industry/community feedback |
| → Anecdotes | Optional | Real-world experience reports |
| Recommendation | ✅ | Final recommendation with specifics |

**Characteristics:**
- **Unique: SWOT analysis and cost analysis per candidate.** No other template does this.
- **Stakeholder-facing** — designed for management buy-in, not developer documentation.
- **No technical consequences, no risk assessment, no deployment, no monitoring.**
- **Heavy** — the deep-dive per candidate can be extensive.
- **Best used for:** Vendor selection, platform adoption, large-scale technology choices.

### 3.8 Planguage (Tom Gilb)

A decision template adapted from Tom Gilb's "Planguage" — a planning language originally designed for specifying non-functional requirements with quantitative rigor.

**Sections (Keywords):**

| Section (Keyword) | Required | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Tag | ✅ | Unique, persistent identifier |
| Gist | ✅ | Brief summary of the requirement or area addressed |
| Requirement | ✅ | The text detailing the requirement itself |
| Rationale | ✅ | Reasoning that justifies the requirement |
| Priority | ✅ | Statement of priority and claim on resources |
| Stakeholders | ✅ | Parties materially affected by the requirement |
| Status | ✅ | `draft`, `reviewed`, `committed`, etc. |
| Owner | ✅ | Person responsible for implementing |
| Author | ✅ | Person who wrote the requirement |
| Revision | ✅ | Version number for the statement |
| Date | ✅ | Date of the most recent revision |
| Assumptions | ✅ | Anything that could cause problems if untrue now or later |
| Risks | ✅ | Anything that could cause malfunction, delay, or negative impacts |
| Defined | Optional | Definition of a term (recommends using a glossary instead) |

**Characteristics:**
- **QA/requirements-engineering lens.** The only ADR template rooted in non-functional requirements specification methodology.
- **Quantitative mindset.** Planguage was designed for measurable quality attributes — e.g., "Response time ≤ 200ms for 95th percentile." This influences the template toward precision.
- **"Tag" as persistent ID** — similar to our `adr.id`, predating all other templates' use of IDs.
- **Explicit `Assumptions` and `Risks`** — shared with Tyree–Akerman. Unique among lightweight templates.
- **`Owner` vs `Author` distinction** — separates who wrote it from who is accountable. Only our schema and this template make this distinction.
- **No alternatives analysis, no consequences, no deployment, no monitoring.**
- **Niche adoption.** Primarily used in Gilb's consulting practice and academic settings. Not widely adopted in open-source ADR workflows.

### 3.9 EdgeX Foundry (Linux Foundation)

The official ADR template for EdgeX Foundry, a Linux Foundation open-source IoT platform. Used for all architecturally significant changes to the EdgeX codebase.

**Sections:**

| Section | Required | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Submitters | ✅ | Name (Organization) — who proposed the ADR |
| Change Log | ✅ | State transitions with dates and PR URLs |
| Referenced Use Case(s) | ✅ | Links to approved use case documents |
| Context | ✅ | Architectural significance justification + high-level approach |
| Proposed Design | ✅ | Services/modules impacted, model/DTO changes, API changes, config changes, devops impact |
| Considerations | ✅ | Alternatives, concerns, issues raised in debate; resolution status |
| Decision | ✅ | Implementation details, caveats, future considerations, unmet requirements |
| Other Related ADRs | Optional | Links with relevance annotations |
| References | Optional | External resources |

**Characteristics:**
- **Change Log with PR links.** The only template that mandates a structured change log with pull request URLs for each state transition. This creates a **built-in audit trail** via git.
- **Use case traceability.** Mandates `Referenced Use Case(s)` — the ADR must link to at least one approved use case. This enforces requirements traceability.
- **Impact-analysis-oriented `Proposed Design`.** Explicitly asks for: services/modules impacted, model/DTO changes, API impact, configuration impact, and devops impact. This is a structured **impact assessment** — unique among templates.
- **`Considerations` as debate log.** Records alternatives and concerns raised during review, with resolution notes. Functions as a lightweight decision journal.
- **No structured consequences, no risk assessment, no monitoring, no formal approval.**
- **Significant adoption.** Used by a major Linux Foundation project with dozens of contributors and enterprise backing.

### 3.10 Merson (CMU/SEI)

A Nygard-derived template by Paulo Merson of Carnegie Mellon's Software Engineering Institute. Famous for explicitly separating **Rationale** as its own section.

**Sections:**

| Section | Required | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Title (with number) | ✅ | "ADR N: brief decision title" |
| Context (in body) | ✅ | Forces that influence the decision (technological, cost, project-local) |
| Decision | ✅ | Response to the forces. Active voice: "We will…" |
| Rationale | ✅ | **Why** the decision was made. Also covers rationale for significant rejected alternatives. May include assumptions, constraints, evaluation results. |
| Status | ✅ | `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Deprecated`, `Superseded` |
| Consequences | ✅ | Resulting context. All consequences, not just positive. |

**Characteristics:**
- **Explicit `Rationale` section** — the defining innovation. Merson's argument: "Why is more important than how" (Richards & Ford, *Fundamentals of Software Architecture*). In Nygard's template, rationale is buried in Context or Decision. Merson forces it to stand alone.
- **Rationale covers rejected alternatives** — the rationale section explicitly includes reasoning for significant alternatives that were *not* chosen. This partially compensates for the lack of a formal alternatives section.
- **Lean (5 sections).** Only one section more than Nygard, but the added section is arguably the most important.
- **SEI backing.** Associated with *Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond* (Bass, Clements, Kazman). Used in O'Reilly architecture katas (Farmacy Food).
- **No metadata, no alternatives list, no risk assessment, no deployment, no monitoring.**
- **Moderate adoption.** Popular in educational settings and architecture kata competitions.

### 3.11 NHS Wales (GIG Cymru)

An ADR template designed by and for NHS Wales (GIG Cymru), a national healthcare system. Notable for coming from a **regulated public-sector** environment where decisions must withstand audit and governance scrutiny.

**Sections:**

| Section | Required | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Title | ✅ | Free-form title |
| Status (admonition) | ✅ | `Proposed`, `Under Review`, `Accepted`, `Rejected`, `Superseded`, `Deprecated` |
| Updated (date) | ✅ | ISO 8601 date |
| Summary | ✅ | Executive summary / elevator pitch (2–4 sentences) |
| Drivers | ✅ | Why this decision is being made *now* — motivations, needs, problems |
| Options | ✅ | Factual description of each option (no opinions — analysis is separate) |
| Options Analysis | ✅ | Per-option assessment: Pro / Con / Other; considers cost, complexity, risks, alignment, impact |
| Recommendation | ✅ | Final decision with explicit justification against drivers |
| → Consequences | Optional | Expected outcomes: Pro / Con / Other |
| → Confirmation | Optional | How implementation will be verified + ongoing compliance ensured + metrics for success + ownership |
| More Information | Optional | Supplementary context, participants, consensus process, re-evaluation triggers |

**Characteristics:**
- **Fact/opinion separation.** `Options` is strictly factual; `Options Analysis` is where judgment lives. This separation reduces cognitive bias during option presentation.
- **Extended `Confirmation` section.** Goes beyond MADR's confirmation by asking: "Who is responsible for overseeing this, and what happens if the decision is not followed?" — explicit ownership and enforcement.
- **`Drivers` as temporal motivator.** Not just "what are the forces" but "why *now*" — adds urgency context.
- **6 statuses** — includes `Under Review` and `Deprecated` alongside the standard set. Most templates have 3–4.
- **MkDocs integration.** Uses MkDocs admonition syntax for status display, suggesting tight integration with documentation-as-code pipelines.
- **Healthcare governance context.** Designed for NHS digital architecture teams where decisions must satisfy clinical safety, data protection (UK GDPR), and NHS Digital standards.

### 3.12 Gareth Morgan (Solution Architecture Decisions)

A template by Gareth Morgan focused on solution architecture decisions with a strong governance and visual comparison emphasis.

**Sections:**

| Section | Required | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Title (with number) | ✅ | `[000] Title` — numbered for cataloging |
| Context | ✅ | Problem(s) the ADR addresses and why they exist |
| Decided Approach | ✅ | The architecturally significant decision and how it addresses the problems |
| Consequences | ✅ | Impact on architecture characteristics and functional requirements |
| Governance | ✅ | How outcomes will be monitored; how compliance will be ensured |
| Options Analysis | Optional | Trade-off analysis with traffic-light comparison matrices |
| → High-Level Overview | Optional | Summary matrix (Ease of Implementation, Timescales, Strategic Value) |
| → Functional Requirements | Optional | Per-scenario fit matrix across options |
| → Non-Functional Requirements | Optional | Per-architecture-characteristic fit matrix across options |

**Characteristics:**
- **Explicit `Governance` section.** The only template with a dedicated governance section asking: *"How will the outcomes of this decision be monitored? How will compliance with this decision be ensured?"* This bridges the gap between decision-making and decision-enforcement.
- **Traffic-light comparison matrices.** Uses color-coded HTML tables (green/amber/red with +/- prefixes) for visual option comparison across three dimensions: high-level summary, functional requirements, and non-functional requirements. Highly stakeholder-friendly.
- **Architecture characteristics framing.** Non-functional requirements are explicitly framed as "architecture characteristics" (à la Richards & Ford), assessed per option.
- **Strategic Value assessment.** The high-level overview matrix includes "Strategic Value" — no other template evaluates options against strategic/tactical positioning.
- **No metadata (beyond number), no risk assessment, no deployment, no monitoring, no audit trail.**

### 3.13 DRF — Decision Reasoning Format (reasoning-formats)

A vendor-neutral, machine-readable YAML/JSON format for structured decision documentation. Not an ADR template per se, but a **complementary specification** designed to add structured reasoning to decisions.

**Structure (two complementary specs):**

| Spec | Purpose | Key Fields |
|------|---------|------------|
| **DRF** (Decision Reasoning Format) | Documents what was decided and why | `id`, `title`, `intent`, `context` (constraints with source, objectives with priority), `reasoning` (patterns: risk-based, comparative), `assumptions`, `tensions` (tradeoffs), `synthesis` (decision + rationale + alternatives), `meta` (status, timestamps) |
| **CRF** (Context Reasoning Format) | Models organizational knowledge as a graph | `entities` (organizations, systems, policies, facts, capabilities), `relationships` (owns, depends_on, constrains, supersedes), `validity` (temporal bounds), `provenance` |

**Characteristics:**
- **Reasoning-first philosophy.** Captures *how* and *why*, not just *what*. Explicitly models assumptions, tensions/tradeoffs, and reasoning patterns used.
- **Organizational context as knowledge graph.** CRF creates a separate, referenceable graph of policies, systems, and constraints. Decisions are validated against this context.
- **Context validation.** DRF decisions can reference CRF entities for automatic conflict detection (e.g., "this decision conflicts with the Kubernetes Moratorium policy"). Advisory, not blocking.
- **Bidirectional updates.** Decisions produce new organizational facts that flow back into CRF — the decision log feeds the organizational knowledge base.
- **Constraint sourcing.** Each constraint carries a `source` (regulatory, budget, technical) — similar to our `compliance_implications.regulatory_impact` but more granular.
- **Draft status (v0.1.0).** Still stabilizing core concepts. No significant adoption yet.
- **Closest to our schema** in philosophy (machine-readable, validation-oriented, structured reasoning) but with a different architectural bet: two complementary specs vs. one unified schema.

## 5. Unique Contributions of Each Template

| Template | Unique Contribution | Adoption |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| **Nygard** | Invented the ADR concept. Proved that minimal format works. | Universal — basis for all others |
| **MADR** | `Confirmation` section ("how do we verify this?"). RACI-like stakeholder model. `Neutral` consequences. | Very high — most GitHub ADR repos use MADR |
| **smadr** | 3-dimensional risk assessment per option (Technical/Schedule/Ecosystem). JSON Schema validation. Audit table for compliance. AI-tooling-ready. Extension fields (`x-*`). | Emerging (2025) |
| **Tyree–Akerman** | `Related Principles`, `Related Artifacts`, `Related Requirements`, `Assumptions`. Enterprise governance depth. | Moderate — enterprise/academic |
| **Y-Statements** | Compression of entire decision into one sentence. Forces extreme clarity. | Niche — used as summaries |
| **Alexandrian** | "Resulting Context" framing — consequences as input for next decision. | Niche — pattern language community |
| **Business Case** | SWOT analysis and cost analysis per candidate. Management-facing. External opinions section. | Moderate — vendor selection |
| **Planguage** | Owner/Author distinction. Priority as a structured field. QA-oriented keyword system from requirements engineering. | Niche — Gilb consulting/academic |
| **EdgeX Foundry** | Change Log with PR links (built-in audit trail). Mandatory use case traceability. Structured impact assessment (API, DTO, model, config, devops). | Significant — Linux Foundation IoT |
| **Merson** | Explicit standalone `Rationale` section. Rationale for rejected alternatives. "Why > How" philosophy (Richards & Ford). | Moderate — SEI/academic/katas |
| **NHS Wales** | Fact/opinion separation (Options vs. Analysis). Extended confirmation with ownership+enforcement. `Under Review` and `Deprecated` statuses. Healthcare governance context. Summary/elevator pitch. | Growing — UK public sector |
| **Gareth Morgan** | Dedicated `Governance` section (monitoring + compliance enforcement). Traffic-light visual comparison matrices. Strategic Value scoring per option. Architecture characteristics framing. | Moderate — solution architecture |
| **DRF** | Reasoning-first philosophy. Organizational context as knowledge graph (CRF). Context validation with conflict detection. Bidirectional updates (decisions → org facts). Constraint sourcing. | Pre-release (v0.1.0) |
| **adr-governance** | Structured security/compliance/operational implications. Phased deployment plans with rollback. Monitoring with metric thresholds and SLA. Formal approval workflow. Lifecycle management (review cadence, archival). Append-only audit trail. | New — this repo only |

## 6. Analysis: Where Standard Templates Fall Short

### 6.1 No Template Has Structured Implications

Every template treats consequences as prose or bullet points. No template in the field provides:
- **Structured security implications** with data classification, encryption specifics, access control details, and audit retention periods
- **Structured compliance implications** with regulatory-to-impact mapping and required controls
- **Structured operational implications** with monitoring requirements, runbook references, and staffing needs

These exist only in our `adr-governance` schema. The closest competitor is **smadr**'s Audit section, but it's a compliance findings table, not a structured implications model.

### 6.2 No Template Has Deployment/Rollback Planning

None of the thirteen external templates include:
- Phased rollout criteria
- Testing matrices (unit, integration, performance, compliance)
- Rollback criteria and procedures

These are typically in separate runbooks. Our schema embeds them for self-containment.

### 6.3 No Template Has Monitoring or SLA

Only our schema links a decision to its runtime monitoring:
- Named metrics with warning/critical thresholds
- Alert routing
- SLA targets (availability, RPO, RTO)

### 6.4 No Template Has Decision Governance Enforcement — Except Morgan

Gareth Morgan is the only template that asks: *"How will compliance with this decision be ensured?"* This is distinct from MADR's `Confirmation` (which asks "how do we verify implementation?") — Morgan asks about **ongoing enforcement**, not just initial validation. Our schema has `audit_trail` and `lifecycle.review_cycle_months` which partially address this, but we lack an explicit governance enforcement field.

### 6.5 No Template Has Structured Impact Assessment — Except EdgeX

EdgeX Foundry uniquely asks authors to enumerate: services/modules impacted, model/DTO changes, API impact, configuration changes, and devops impact. This is a lightweight **change impact analysis** that no other template captures. Our schema has `deployment` for rollout planning, but we don't explicitly ask "what will this decision break or change?"

### 6.6 No Template Captures Rationale for Rejected Alternatives — Except Merson and DRF

Merson's template explicitly includes reasoning for significant alternatives that were *not* chosen in its `Rationale` section. DRF similarly stores alternatives with their rejection reasoning in `synthesis`. Our `alternatives` section captures pros/cons for each option, but we don't have a dedicated field explaining *why* rejected alternatives were rejected. The rationale is implied by the chosen option's `rationale` field, but it's not explicit.

### 6.7 Features We're Missing

| Feature | Source | Value | Priority |
|---------|--------|-------|----------|
| **`confirmation`** | MADR 4.0, NHS Wales | "How will we verify this decision was implemented correctly?" — links decision to validation. NHS Wales extends this with ownership and enforcement questions. | ✅ **Add** |
| **`governance_enforcement`** | Gareth Morgan | "How will compliance be monitored? Who is accountable?" — bridges decision to operational enforcement. | ⚠️ **Consider** |
| **`impact_assessment`** | EdgeX Foundry | Structured list of systems/APIs/configurations impacted. Lightweight change impact analysis. | ⚠️ **Consider** |
| **`rationale_for_rejected`** | Merson, DRF | Explicit reasoning for why significant alternatives were *not* chosen. | ✅ **Add** |
| **`summary`** | NHS Wales | Executive elevator pitch (2–4 sentences). Helps stakeholders triage ADRs without reading the full document. | ⚠️ **Consider** |

## 7. Synthesis: Recommendations for Our Schema

### 7.1 What to Keep (Our Schema is Best-in-Class)

Our `adr-governance` schema is the most comprehensive ADR meta-model in the field. The following sections are **unique and valuable** — no other template provides them:

1. **`security_implications`** — structured sub-fields for data classification, encryption, access control, and audit retention. Essential for regulated environments.
2. **`compliance_implications`** — regulatory impact mapping and required controls list. Critical for PSD2/GDPR/DORA compliance.
3. **`operational_implications`** — monitoring, runbooks, staffing. Bridges the gap between architecture decision and operational reality.
4. **`deployment`** — phased rollout, testing matrix, rollback plan. Ensures decisions are not just recorded but actionable.
5. **`monitoring`** — metrics with thresholds, alerts, SLA. Links decision to production observability.
6. **`approvals`** with signature IDs — formal governance for regulated environments.
7. **`audit_trail`** — append-only event log. Satisfies auditability requirements.
8. **`lifecycle`** — review cadence and archival. Prevents decision rot.
9. **`schema_version`** — pins each ADR to a specific schema version. Future-proofs the format.

These are all enterprise-grade extensions that we invented. They should be preserved and documented as the **"Enterprise ADR extensions"** of this project.

### 7.2 What to Consider Adding

| Candidate Field | Source Template | Recommendation | Rationale |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| **`confirmation`** | MADR 4.0, NHS Wales | ✅ **Add** | Answers "how do we verify this decision was implemented?" NHS Wales extends this with ownership and enforcement. Could be a field under `decision` or a new top-level section with `description` (free text) and `artifacts` (list of verification artifact IDs). |
| **`extension_fields` (x-*)** | smadr | ✅ **Add** | Allowing custom `x-*` prefixed fields in the schema gives teams flexibility without breaking validation. Simple to implement in JSON Schema via `patternProperties`. |
| **`summary`** | NHS Wales | ✅ **Add** | Executive elevator pitch (2–4 sentences). Enables stakeholder triage without reading full ADRs. Trivial to add as a string field in `adr` metadata. |
| **`impact_assessment`** | EdgeX Foundry | ⚠️ **Consider** | Structured list of impacted systems, APIs, configurations. Useful for change-heavy decisions. Could be added under `consequences` or as a standalone section. |
| **`rationale_for_rejected`** | Merson, DRF | ✅ **Add** | Per-alternative rejection reasoning. Our `alternatives[].cons` partially covers this, but explicit "why not" for each rejected option is clearer. Add as a new optional field on each alternative: `rejection_rationale`. |
| **`related_principles`** | Tyree–Akerman | ⚠️ **Consider** | Links decisions to enterprise architecture principles. Valuable for organizations with a formal principles registry (e.g., TOGAF). Add if/when we have a principles registry. |
| **`risk_per_option` (3D)** | smadr | ❌ **Skip** | smadr's Technical/Schedule/Ecosystem risk model is interesting but our per-option `risk` field combined with the overall `risk_assessment` section provides equivalent coverage. |
| **`neutral_consequences`** | MADR 4.0 | ❌ **Skip** | Neutral consequences are rarely informative. Our positive/negative split is sufficient. |
| **`decision_drivers`** (unified list) | MADR / smadr | ❌ **Skip** | Our `business_drivers` + `technical_drivers` split is more informative than a flat list. |
| **`swot_per_option`** | Business Case | ❌ **Skip** | Overlaps with our pros/cons/cost/risk per alternative. SWOT is a management lens, not an engineering lens. |
| **`context_validation`** | DRF | ❌ **Skip (for now)** | DRF's organizational context graph (CRF) is architecturally novel but requires building a separate knowledge graph infrastructure. Worth revisiting when DRF matures past v0.1.0. |

### 7.3 What to Document

Our `security_implications`, `compliance_implications`, and `operational_implications` fields are **the most novel contribution** of this schema. They should be explicitly documented as:

> **Enterprise ADR Extensions** — structured consequence sub-sections designed for regulated environments where decisions must be traceable to security controls, regulatory requirements, and operational readiness. These are not part of any standard ADR template; they are a custom extension of the `adr-governance` meta-model.

This prevents future confusion about whether they come from a standard.

## 9. Conclusion

Having surveyed **14 templates** (13 external + our own), we can now position `adr-governance` with much higher confidence. Our schema sits at the **maximum comprehensiveness** end of the ADR template spectrum. It is the only template that combines:

- MADR-style alternatives analysis with pros/cons
- Tyree–Akerman-style enterprise governance (assumptions, constraints, related artifacts)
- Structured implications (security, compliance, operational) — **unique to us**
- Deployment planning with rollback — **unique to us**
- Runtime monitoring with SLA — **unique to us**
- Formal approval workflow — **unique to us**
- Machine-readable YAML with JSON Schema validation

The expanded survey surfaced several **newly identified gaps** worth closing:

| Priority | Field | Source | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| 🟢 High | `confirmation` | MADR 4.0 + NHS Wales | Add to schema |
| 🟢 High | `summary` | NHS Wales | Add to `adr` metadata |
| 🟢 High | `extension_fields` (x-*) | smadr | Add via `patternProperties` |
| 🟡 Medium | `impact_assessment` | EdgeX Foundry | Consider adding under `consequences` |
| � High | `rationale_for_rejected` | Merson, DRF | Add as per-alternative field |
| ⚪ Low | `context_validation` | DRF | Watch for DRF maturity |

The tradeoff remains **weight**: a full `adr-governance` ADR is significantly heavier than a Nygard or MADR record. This is acceptable for our use case (enterprise IAM decisions in regulated financial services) but would be overkill for a startup documenting database choices.

The closest philosophical neighbor is **DRF** (reasoning-first, machine-readable, validation-oriented), but it takes a fundamentally different architectural approach (two complementary specs vs. one unified schema) and is still in early draft (v0.1.0). Worth monitoring.

## 10. ADR Ecosystem Insights

The Henderson repository and related sources contain several important concepts beyond templates that are relevant to ADR governance:

### 10.1 Fitness Functions for Decisions as Code

**Fitness functions** are objective automated checks that verify decisions are being maintained. They make decisions testable and assurable.

- **Connection:** A decision record documents the decision; a fitness function *assures* the decision.
- **Example:** Decision = "We use event sourcing for audit requirements." Fitness function = CI test that all state changes produce events.
- **Tools:** [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/) (Java), [ArchUnitTS](https://github.com/LukasNiessen/ArchUnitTS) (TypeScript/JavaScript).
- **AI-assisted:** Henderson suggests using LLMs as fitness function evaluators, asking them to audit code/schemas against the decision log.
- **Relevance to us:** Our `confirmation` field (when added) could reference fitness functions. Our CI pipeline already validates ADR YAML — this is itself a fitness function.

### 10.2 Decision Guardian — PR-Level Enforcement

[Decision Guardian](https://github.com/DecispherHQ/decision-guardian) automatically surfaces relevant ADRs on pull requests when a developer modifies code covered by those decisions. Works with any CI system and as a pre-commit hook.

- **Relevance:** Addresses Gareth Morgan's "governance enforcement" question — decisions are surfaced *at the moment they're most likely to be violated*.
- **Action:** Evaluate for integration with our GitHub Actions CI pipeline.

### 10.3 Teamwork Advice (Henderson)

Key practical insights from teams using ADRs at scale:

1. **Name the directory `decisions/` not `adrs/`** — teams document more (vendor decisions, planning decisions, scheduling decisions) when the directory name uses plain language.
2. **Mutability works better than immutability in practice** — insert new info with date stamps rather than creating a new ADR for every update. "Living document" approach.
3. **Lead with "why" not "what"** — ADRs are not valuable if they're just after-the-fact paperwork.
4. **After-action reviews** — review each ADR one month later to compare the documented expectations with actual practice.

### 10.4 Related Formalisms

The Henderson repo references several pre-ADR decision documentation formalisms that influenced the field:

| Formalism | Full Name | Relevance |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **IBIS** | Issue-Based Information System | Question → Position → Argument structure. Influenced dialogue mapping. |
| **QOC** | Questions, Options, Criteria | Similar to ADR alternatives analysis. Academic predecessor. |
| **DRL** | Decision Representation Language | Formal decision trees. More rigorous than ADR prose. |
| **REMAP** | Representation and Maintenance of Process Knowledge | Process-oriented decision capture. |
| **DRF** | Decision Reasoning Format | Modern YAML/JSON successor. See Section 3.13. |

### 10.5 Company-Specific ADR Guidance

- **[AWS Prescriptive Guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/architectural-decision-records/adr-process.html):** Formal ADR process with lifecycle (Proposed → Review → Accepted/Rejected → Superseded). Recommends that ADRs are consulted during code and architectural reviews. Treats ADRs as immutable after acceptance.
- **[RedHat](https://www.redhat.com/architect/architecture-decision-records):** Advocates ADRs for enterprise architects.
- **[GitHub ADR org](https://adr.github.io/):** Maintains MADR and the broader ADR standards ecosystem.
