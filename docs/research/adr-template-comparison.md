# ADR Template Comparison Research

> **Date:** 2026-03-05
> **Author:** Ivan Stambuk
> **Status:** Final — HISTORICAL REFERENCE
> **Repository:** `adr-governance`

> ⚠️ **This document was created during the initial schema design phase and may reference features that were subsequently adopted, modified, or removed (e.g., `risk_assessment` was removed, `summary` and `rejection_rationale` were adopted). Refer to the current [`schemas/adr.schema.json`](../../schemas/adr.schema.json) as the source of truth.**

## 1. Purpose

This document surveys and compares the major Architecture Decision Record (ADR) template formats in use today. The goal is to:

1. Catalogue the **structural sections** of each template
2. Identify **where our `adr-governance` schema** stands relative to the field
3. Produce a **feature comparison matrix**
4. Provide a **synthesis** with recommendations for our schema

## 3. Template-by-Template Analysis

### 3.1 Nygard (2011) — The Original

The foundational ADR format. Intentionally minimal.

**Sections:**

| Section | Required | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Title | ✅ | Short noun phrase |
| Status | ✅ | `proposed`, `accepted`, `deprecated`, `superseded` |
| Context | ✅ | Forces at play — technical, political, social. Value-neutral language |
| Decision | ✅ | "We will…" — active voice, full sentences |
| Consequences | ✅ | What becomes easier or harder. Positive and negative, no sub-structure |

**Characteristics:**
- **5 sections, all required.** No optional sections.
- **No metadata** — no date, no author, no tags, no ID.
- **No alternatives analysis** — only the chosen decision is recorded.
- **Flat consequences** — single narrative block, no structured sub-fields.
- **Design philosophy:** "Short enough to fit on one page." Append-only — never edit, only supersede.
- **Tooling:** `adr-tools` (npryce/adr-tools) provides CLI for file management.

**What it lacks:** Alternatives comparison, risk assessment, author tracking, dates, formal review/approval, compliance implications, deployment planning, monitoring, audit trail.

---

### 3.2 MADR 4.0 (2024) — Markdown Any Decision Record

The most widely adopted structured ADR template. Maintained by the `adr` GitHub organization. Olaf Zimmermann is a contributor.

**Sections:**

| Section | Required | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| YAML Frontmatter | Optional | `status`, `date`, `decision-makers`, `consulted`, `informed` |
| Title (H1) | ✅ | Represents problem + solution |
| Context and Problem Statement | ✅ | Free-form or illustrative story |
| Decision Drivers | Optional | Bullet list of forces/concerns |
| Considered Options | ✅ | List of option titles |
| Decision Outcome | ✅ | Chosen option with `because` justification |
| → Consequences | Optional | `Good, because…` / `Bad, because…` / `Neutral, because…` |
| → Confirmation | Optional | How compliance with the ADR will be verified |
| Pros and Cons of the Options | Optional | Per-option breakdown: Good / Neutral / Bad bullets |
| More Information | Optional | Links, team agreement, realization timeline |

**Characteristics:**
- **~10 sections, 3 required.** Optional metadata in YAML frontmatter.
- **RACI-like stakeholder model** in frontmatter: `decision-makers`, `consulted`, `informed`.
- **Pros/Cons per option** — structured comparison of alternatives.
- **Consequences are labeled** — `Good, because…` / `Bad, because…` — but not sub-categorized (no security/compliance/operational split).
- **Confirmation section** — unique to MADR: "how will we verify this decision was implemented correctly?" (e.g., code review, ArchUnit test).
- **No risk assessment, no deployment plan, no monitoring, no audit trail.**
- **No formal approval workflow** — `decision-makers` is informational only.

---

### 3.3 Structured MADR / smadr (2025) — Machine-Readable Extension

An extension of MADR designed for machine consumption, AI tooling, and compliance auditing.

**Sections:**

| Section | Required | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| YAML Frontmatter | ✅ | `title`, `description`, `type`, `category`, `tags`, `status`, `created`, `updated`, `author`, `project` |
| Optional Frontmatter | — | `technologies`, `audience`, `related` (links to other smadr files) |
| Extension Fields | — | `x-*` prefixed custom metadata |
| Status | ✅ | Markdown body — current decision status |
| Context | ✅ | Background, problem statement, current limitations |
| Decision Drivers | ✅ | Primary and secondary factors |
| Considered Options | ✅ | Per-option: description, characteristics, advantages, disadvantages, **risk assessment** |
| → Risk Assessment (per option) | ✅ | **Technical Risk** (Low/Med/High), **Schedule Risk**, **Ecosystem Risk** |
| Decision | ✅ | Chosen approach with implementation details |
| Consequences | ✅ | Positive, negative, neutral |
| Decision Outcome | ✅ | Summary with mitigations for negative consequences |
| Related Decisions | Optional | Links to related ADRs |
| Links | Optional | External resources |
| More Information | Optional | Date, source, references |
| **Audit** | Optional | **Compliance tracking with findings table** |

**Characteristics:**
- **Most structured of the Markdown-based templates.**
- **JSON Schema for frontmatter validation** — machine-parseable metadata.
- **Three-dimensional risk assessment per option** (Technical, Schedule, Ecosystem) — unique feature.
- **Audit section** for compliance tracking — SOC2, HIPAA, ISO 27001.
- **AI-ready** — explicitly designed for Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor integration.
- **No deployment plan, no monitoring, no SLA, no approval workflow.**
- **No structured security/compliance/operational implications** — these would go in free-text Consequences or Audit.

### 3.4 Tyree–Akerman (2005) — IEEE Enterprise Template

The most comprehensive traditional ADR template. Published in IEEE Software.

**Sections:**

| Section | Required | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Issue | ✅ | Design issue being addressed |
| Decision | ✅ | Chosen direction/position |
| Status | ✅ | `pending`, `decided`, `approved` |
| Group | ✅ | Category (integration, presentation, data, etc.) |
| Assumptions | ✅ | Cost, schedule, technology assumptions |
| Constraints | ✅ | Additional limitations imposed by the decision |
| Positions | ✅ | All viable alternatives with models/diagrams |
| Argument | ✅ | Reasoning for chosen position over alternatives |
| Implications | ✅ | Required follow-ups, new requirements, staff training |
| Related Decisions | ✅ | Links to connected architectural decisions |
| Related Requirements | ✅ | Mapping to business objectives |
| Related Artifacts | ✅ | Architecture/design/scope documents impacted |
| Related Principles | ✅ | Enterprise policies and principles influencing the decision |
| Notes | ✅ | Discussion items and issues raised |

**Characteristics:**
- **14 sections, most required.** The heaviest template.
- **Unique sections:** `Assumptions`, `Constraints`, `Related Principles`, `Related Artifacts`, `Notes`.
- **Enterprise governance-oriented:** explicit links to requirements, principles, and artifacts.
- **No structured consequences** — `Implications` is a single section.
- **No risk assessment, no deployment plan, no monitoring, no audit trail.**
- **No metadata** — no date, author, tags, or ID in the original template.
- **Criticism:** Feels bureaucratic for smaller decisions. 15+ sections is a high bar.

---

### 3.5 Y-Statements (2012) — Ultra-Minimal

A single structured sentence capturing the entire decision.

**Structure:**

```
In the context of {use case},
  facing {non-functional concern},
  we decided for {option}
  and neglected {alternatives},
  to achieve {quality benefit},
  accepting that {tradeoff/downside}
  [because {additional rationale}].
```

**Characteristics:**
- **1 "section" — a single sentence.** The most minimal format.
- **Forces extreme clarity** — you must compress the entire decision into one statement.
- **No metadata, no alternatives analysis, no risk assessment, no consequences breakdown.**
- **Best used as:** A summary or index entry, not as a standalone record.
- **Often combined with other templates** — Y-Statement as the abstract, MADR as the body.

---

### 3.6 Alexandrian (Pattern Language)

Inspired by Christopher Alexander's pattern language.

**Sections:**

| Section | Required | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Prologue (Summary) | ✅ | Brief overview |
| Discussion (Context) | ✅ | Problem, forces, background — written as a narrative |
| Solution (Decision) | ✅ | The architectural response |
| Consequences (Resulting Context) | ✅ | What changes after applying the solution |

**Characteristics:**
- **4 sections.** Narrative style — reads like a design pattern.
- **"Resulting Context"** explicitly frames consequences as the new context for future decisions.
- **Encourages linking** — patterns reference related patterns, forming a language.
- **No metadata, no alternatives, no risk, no approval, no deployment.**
- **Philosophy:** Decisions are patterns; the ADR log is a pattern language.

---

### 3.7 Business Case (Henderson)

Oriented toward management stakeholders and financial justification.

**Sections:**

| Section | Required | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Title | ✅ | Short imperative phrase |
| Status | ✅ | Standard status values |
| Evaluation Criteria | ✅ | What we're evaluating and why |
| Candidates to Consider | ✅ | All options with outlier notes |
| Research and Analysis | ✅ | Per-candidate deep dive |
| → Criteria Assessment | ✅ | Does/doesn't meet criteria and why |
| → Cost Analysis | ✅ | Licensing, training, operating, metering costs |
| → SWOT Analysis | ✅ | Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats per candidate |
| → Internal Opinions | ✅ | Team and stakeholder feedback |
| → External Opinions | Optional | Industry/community feedback |
| → Anecdotes | Optional | Real-world experience reports |
| Recommendation | ✅ | Final recommendation with specifics |

**Characteristics:**
- **Unique: SWOT analysis and cost analysis per candidate.** No other template does this.
- **Stakeholder-facing** — designed for management buy-in, not developer documentation.
- **No technical consequences, no risk assessment, no deployment, no monitoring.**
- **Heavy** — the deep-dive per candidate can be extensive.
- **Best used for:** Vendor selection, platform adoption, large-scale technology choices.

### 3.8 Planguage (Tom Gilb)

A decision template adapted from Tom Gilb's "Planguage" — a planning language originally designed for specifying non-functional requirements with quantitative rigor.

**Sections (Keywords):**

| Section (Keyword) | Required | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Tag | ✅ | Unique, persistent identifier |
| Gist | ✅ | Brief summary of the requirement or area addressed |
| Requirement | ✅ | The text detailing the requirement itself |
| Rationale | ✅ | Reasoning that justifies the requirement |
| Priority | ✅ | Statement of priority and claim on resources |
| Stakeholders | ✅ | Parties materially affected by the requirement |
| Status | ✅ | `draft`, `reviewed`, `committed`, etc. |
| Owner | ✅ | Person responsible for implementing |
| Author | ✅ | Person who wrote the requirement |
| Revision | ✅ | Version number for the statement |
| Date | ✅ | Date of the most recent revision |
| Assumptions | ✅ | Anything that could cause problems if untrue now or later |
| Risks | ✅ | Anything that could cause malfunction, delay, or negative impacts |
| Defined | Optional | Definition of a term (recommends using a glossary instead) |

**Characteristics:**
- **QA/requirements-engineering lens.** The only ADR template rooted in non-functional requirements specification methodology.
- **Quantitative mindset.** Planguage was designed for measurable quality attributes — e.g., "Response time ≤ 200ms for 95th percentile." This influences the template toward precision.
- **"Tag" as persistent ID** — similar to our `adr.id`, predating all other templates' use of IDs.
- **Explicit `Assumptions` and `Risks`** — shared with Tyree–Akerman. Unique among lightweight templates.
- **`Owner` vs `Author` distinction** — separates who wrote it from who is accountable. Only our schema and this template make this distinction.
- **No alternatives analysis, no consequences, no deployment, no monitoring.**
- **Niche adoption.** Primarily used in Gilb's consulting practice and academic settings. Not widely adopted in open-source ADR workflows.

### 3.9 EdgeX Foundry (Linux Foundation)

The official ADR template for EdgeX Foundry, a Linux Foundation open-source IoT platform. Used for all architecturally significant changes to the EdgeX codebase.

**Sections:**

| Section | Required | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Submitters | ✅ | Name (Organization) — who proposed the ADR |
| Change Log | ✅ | State transitions with dates and PR URLs |
| Referenced Use Case(s) | ✅ | Links to approved use case documents |
| Context | ✅ | Architectural significance justification + high-level approach |
| Proposed Design | ✅ | Services/modules impacted, model/DTO changes, API changes, config changes, devops impact |
| Considerations | ✅ | Alternatives, concerns, issues raised in debate; resolution status |
| Decision | ✅ | Implementation details, caveats, future considerations, unmet requirements |
| Other Related ADRs | Optional | Links with relevance annotations |
| References | Optional | External resources |

**Characteristics:**
- **Change Log with PR links.** The only template that mandates a structured change log with pull request URLs for each state transition. This creates a **built-in audit trail** via git.
- **Use case traceability.** Mandates `Referenced Use Case(s)` — the ADR must link to at least one approved use case. This enforces requirements traceability.
- **Impact-analysis-oriented `Proposed Design`.** Explicitly asks for: services/modules impacted, model/DTO changes, API impact, configuration impact, and devops impact. This is a structured **impact assessment** — unique among templates.
- **`Considerations` as debate log.** Records alternatives and concerns raised during review, with resolution notes. Functions as a lightweight decision journal.
- **No structured consequences, no risk assessment, no monitoring, no formal approval.**
- **Significant adoption.** Used by a major Linux Foundation project with dozens of contributors and enterprise backing.

### 3.10 Merson (CMU/SEI)

A Nygard-derived template by Paulo Merson of Carnegie Mellon's Software Engineering Institute. Famous for explicitly separating **Rationale** as its own section.

**Sections:**

| Section | Required | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Title (with number) | ✅ | "ADR N: brief decision title" |
| Context (in body) | ✅ | Forces that influence the decision (technological, cost, project-local) |
| Decision | ✅ | Response to the forces. Active voice: "We will…" |
| Rationale | ✅ | **Why** the decision was made. Also covers rationale for significant rejected alternatives. May include assumptions, constraints, evaluation results. |
| Status | ✅ | `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Deprecated`, `Superseded` |
| Consequences | ✅ | Resulting context. All consequences, not just positive. |

**Characteristics:**
- **Explicit `Rationale` section** — the defining innovation. Merson's argument: "Why is more important than how" (Richards & Ford, *Fundamentals of Software Architecture*). In Nygard's template, rationale is buried in Context or Decision. Merson forces it to stand alone.
- **Rationale covers rejected alternatives** — the rationale section explicitly includes reasoning for significant alternatives that were *not* chosen. This partially compensates for the lack of a formal alternatives section.
- **Lean (5 sections).** Only one section more than Nygard, but the added section is arguably the most important.
- **SEI backing.** Associated with *Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond* (Bass, Clements, Kazman). Used in O'Reilly architecture katas (Farmacy Food).
- **No metadata, no alternatives list, no risk assessment, no deployment, no monitoring.**
- **Moderate adoption.** Popular in educational settings and architecture kata competitions.

### 3.11 NHS Wales (GIG Cymru)

An ADR template designed by and for NHS Wales (GIG Cymru), a national healthcare system. Notable for coming from a **regulated public-sector** environment where decisions must withstand audit and governance scrutiny.

**Sections:**

| Section | Required | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Title | ✅ | Free-form title |
| Status (admonition) | ✅ | `Proposed`, `Under Review`, `Accepted`, `Rejected`, `Superseded`, `Deprecated` |
| Updated (date) | ✅ | ISO 8601 date |
| Summary | ✅ | Executive summary / elevator pitch (2–4 sentences) |
| Drivers | ✅ | Why this decision is being made *now* — motivations, needs, problems |
| Options | ✅ | Factual description of each option (no opinions — analysis is separate) |
| Options Analysis | ✅ | Per-option assessment: Pro / Con / Other; considers cost, complexity, risks, alignment, impact |
| Recommendation | ✅ | Final decision with explicit justification against drivers |
| → Consequences | Optional | Expected outcomes: Pro / Con / Other |
| → Confirmation | Optional | How implementation will be verified + ongoing compliance ensured + metrics for success + ownership |
| More Information | Optional | Supplementary context, participants, consensus process, re-evaluation triggers |

**Characteristics:**
- **Fact/opinion separation.** `Options` is strictly factual; `Options Analysis` is where judgment lives. This separation reduces cognitive bias during option presentation.
- **Extended `Confirmation` section.** Goes beyond MADR's confirmation by asking: "Who is responsible for overseeing this, and what happens if the decision is not followed?" — explicit ownership and enforcement.
- **`Drivers` as temporal motivator.** Not just "what are the forces" but "why *now*" — adds urgency context.
- **6 statuses** — includes `Under Review` and `Deprecated` alongside the standard set. Most templates have 3–4.
- **MkDocs integration.** Uses MkDocs admonition syntax for status display, suggesting tight integration with documentation-as-code pipelines.
- **Healthcare governance context.** Designed for NHS digital architecture teams where decisions must satisfy clinical safety, data protection (UK GDPR), and NHS Digital standards.

### 3.12 Gareth Morgan (Solution Architecture Decisions)

A template by Gareth Morgan focused on solution architecture decisions with a strong governance and visual comparison emphasis.

**Sections:**

| Section | Required | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Title (with number) | ✅ | `[000] Title` — numbered for cataloging |
| Context | ✅ | Problem(s) the ADR addresses and why they exist |
| Decided Approach | ✅ | The architecturally significant decision and how it addresses the problems |
| Consequences | ✅ | Impact on architecture characteristics and functional requirements |
| Governance | ✅ | How outcomes will be monitored; how compliance will be ensured |
| Options Analysis | Optional | Trade-off analysis with traffic-light comparison matrices |
| → High-Level Overview | Optional | Summary matrix (Ease of Implementation, Timescales, Strategic Value) |
| → Functional Requirements | Optional | Per-scenario fit matrix across options |
| → Non-Functional Requirements | Optional | Per-architecture-characteristic fit matrix across options |

**Characteristics:**
- **Explicit `Governance` section.** The only template with a dedicated governance section asking: *"How will the outcomes of this decision be monitored? How will compliance with this decision be ensured?"* This bridges the gap between decision-making and decision-enforcement.
- **Traffic-light comparison matrices.** Uses color-coded HTML tables (green/amber/red with +/- prefixes) for visual option comparison across three dimensions: high-level summary, functional requirements, and non-functional requirements. Highly stakeholder-friendly.
- **Architecture characteristics framing.** Non-functional requirements are explicitly framed as "architecture characteristics" (à la Richards & Ford), assessed per option.
- **Strategic Value assessment.** The high-level overview matrix includes "Strategic Value" — no other template evaluates options against strategic/tactical positioning.
- **No metadata (beyond number), no risk assessment, no deployment, no monitoring, no audit trail.**

---

### 3.13 DRF — Decision Reasoning Format (reasoning-formats)

A vendor-neutral, machine-readable YAML/JSON format for structured decision documentation. Not an ADR template per se, but a **complementary specification** designed to add structured reasoning to decisions.

**Structure (two complementary specs):**

| Spec | Purpose | Key Fields |
|------|---------|------------|
| **DRF** (Decision Reasoning Format) | Documents what was decided and why | `id`, `title`, `intent`, `context` (constraints with source, objectives with priority), `reasoning` (patterns: risk-based, comparative), `assumptions`, `tensions` (tradeoffs), `synthesis` (decision + rationale + alternatives), `meta` (status, timestamps) |
| **CRF** (Context Reasoning Format) | Models organizational knowledge as a graph | `entities` (organizations, systems, policies, facts, capabilities), `relationships` (owns, depends_on, constrains, supersedes), `validity` (temporal bounds), `provenance` |

**Characteristics:**
- **Reasoning-first philosophy.** Captures *how* and *why*, not just *what*. Explicitly models assumptions, tensions/tradeoffs, and reasoning patterns used.
- **Organizational context as knowledge graph.** CRF creates a separate, referenceable graph of policies, systems, and constraints. Decisions are validated against this context.
- **Context validation.** DRF decisions can reference CRF entities for automatic conflict detection (e.g., "this decision conflicts with the Kubernetes Moratorium policy"). Advisory, not blocking.
- **Bidirectional updates.** Decisions produce new organizational facts that flow back into CRF — the decision log feeds the organizational knowledge base.
- **Constraint sourcing.** Each constraint carries a `source` (regulatory, budget, technical) — more granular than our `context.constraints` field.
- **Draft status (v0.1.0).** Still stabilizing core concepts. No significant adoption yet.
- **Closest to our schema** in philosophy (machine-readable, validation-oriented, structured reasoning) but with a different architectural bet: two complementary specs vs. one unified schema.

| `references` | Optional | External links and evidence |
| `lifecycle` | Optional | `review_cycle_months`, `next_review_date`, `superseded_by`, `supersedes`, `archival` |
| `audit_trail` | Optional | Append-only event log: `event`, `by`, `at`, `details` |

**Characteristics:**
- **Most comprehensive template in this survey.** ~15 top-level sections.
- **Machine-readable YAML** with JSON Schema validation.
- **Unique sections not found in any other template:**
  - `confirmation` (description + verification artifact IDs — inspired by MADR 4.0 / NHS Wales)
  - `audit_trail` (append-only event log with timestamps)
  - `approvals` (formal approval workflow with signature IDs)
  - `lifecycle` (review cadence, next review date, archival policy)
  - `schema_version` (pins ADR to specific schema version)
- **Formal approval workflow** — only template with `approvals` as a structured section.
- **Self-contained** — no external references needed to understand the decision.

| **Business Case** | SWOT analysis and cost analysis per candidate. Management-facing. External opinions section. | Moderate — vendor selection |
| **Planguage** | Owner/Author distinction. Priority as a structured field. QA-oriented keyword system from requirements engineering. | Niche — Gilb consulting/academic |
| **EdgeX Foundry** | Change Log with PR links (built-in audit trail). Mandatory use case traceability. Structured impact assessment (API, DTO, model, config, devops). | Significant — Linux Foundation IoT |
| **Merson** | Explicit standalone `Rationale` section. Rationale for rejected alternatives. "Why > How" philosophy (Richards & Ford). | Moderate — SEI/academic/katas |

| **Gareth Morgan** | Dedicated `Governance` section (monitoring + compliance enforcement). Traffic-light visual comparison matrices. Strategic Value scoring per option. Architecture characteristics framing. | Moderate — solution architecture |
| **DRF** | Reasoning-first philosophy. Organizational context as knowledge graph (CRF). Context validation with conflict detection. Bidirectional updates (decisions → org facts). Constraint sourcing. | Pre-release (v0.1.0) |
| **adr-governance** | Confirmation with verification artifact IDs. Formal approval workflow with signature IDs. Append-only audit trail. Lifecycle management (review cadence, supersession, archival). Machine-readable YAML with JSON Schema validation. Per-alternative risk rating + rejection rationale. | New — this repo only |

## 6. Analysis: Where Standard Templates Fall Short

### 6.1 No Template Has Structured Implications

Every template treats consequences as prose or bullet points. No template in the field (including ours) provides:
- **Structured security implications** with data classification, encryption specifics, access control details, and audit retention periods
- **Structured compliance implications** with regulatory-to-impact mapping and required controls
- **Structured operational implications** with monitoring requirements, runbook references, and staffing needs

These were considered for our schema but ultimately removed to keep ADRs focused on decisions rather than operational runbooks. They remain a potential future enhancement for regulated-environment profiles.

### 6.2 No Template Has Deployment/Rollback Planning

No template includes:
- Phased rollout criteria
- Testing matrices (unit, integration, performance, compliance)
- Rollback criteria and procedures

These are typically in separate runbooks. Some organizations may wish to embed them in ADRs for self-containment, but no template (including ours) currently does this.

### 6.3 No Template Has Monitoring or SLA

No template links a decision to its runtime monitoring:
- Named metrics with warning/critical thresholds
- Alert routing
- SLA targets (availability, RPO, RTO)

These were considered for our schema but removed as they belong in operational runbooks rather than decision records.

### 6.4 No Template Has Decision Governance Enforcement — Except Morgan

Gareth Morgan is the only template that asks: *"How will compliance with this decision be ensured?"* This is distinct from MADR's `Confirmation` (which asks "how do we verify implementation?") — Morgan asks about **ongoing enforcement**, not just initial validation. Our schema has `audit_trail` and `lifecycle.review_cycle_months` which partially address this, but we lack an explicit governance enforcement field.

> **Resolution (2026-03-06):** After analysis, we decided **not** to add a `governance_enforcement` field to the schema. ADRs capture decisions — enforcement is the responsibility of downstream tooling and processes. Architecture should not point to code; code should point to architecture. Teams that depend on a decision enforce it through their own mechanisms: CODEOWNERS, PR templates with ADR compliance checklists, ArchUnit fitness functions, CI policies, etc. Those are implementation details that vary by organization and codebase. Our `confirmation` section already captures *how implementation is verified*; ongoing enforcement is an operational concern, not a decision record concern.

### 6.5 No Template Has Structured Impact Assessment — Except EdgeX

EdgeX Foundry uniquely asks authors to enumerate: services/modules impacted, model/DTO changes, API impact, configuration changes, and devops impact. This is a lightweight **change impact analysis** that no other template captures.

> **Resolution (2026-03-06):** After detailed analysis, we decided **not** to add `impact_assessment`. EdgeX's context (change proposals for a specific, well-defined codebase with known services and DTOs) differs from ours (architectural pattern decisions where impacted systems depend on the adopting organization). In our ADRs, impact information is already captured across `dependencies.internal` (what systems are involved), `consequences.negative` (operational costs), and `decision.tradeoffs` (what teams must adapt). Adding a dedicated section would create overlap and author confusion about field boundaries. Teams needing EdgeX-style structured impact can use `x-impact-assessment` via extension fields.

### 6.6 No Template Captures Rationale for Rejected Alternatives — Except Merson and DRF

Merson's template explicitly includes reasoning for significant alternatives that were *not* chosen in its `Rationale` section. DRF similarly stores alternatives with their rejection reasoning in `synthesis`. Our `alternatives` section captures pros/cons for each option, but we don't have a dedicated field explaining *why* rejected alternatives were rejected. The rationale is implied by the chosen option's `rationale` field, but it's not explicit.

### 6.7 Features Still Missing

All identified feature gaps have been resolved. See §7.2 for the full adoption tracker.

> **Resolved items:** `confirmation` (✅ added), `summary` (✅ added as `adr.summary`), `rationale_for_rejected` (✅ added as `alternatives[].rejection_rationale`), `impact_assessment` (❌ skipped — see §6.5), `governance_enforcement` (❌ skipped — see §6.4; enforcement is downstream, not a decision record concern).

## 7. Synthesis: Recommendations for Our Schema

### 7.1 What to Keep (Our Schema is Best-in-Class)

Our `adr-governance` schema is the most comprehensive ADR meta-model in the field. The following sections are **unique and valuable** — no other template provides them:

1. **`confirmation`** — description + verification artifact IDs. Inspired by MADR 4.0 / NHS Wales but with structured artifact references.
2. **`approvals`** with signature IDs — formal governance for regulated environments.
3. **`audit_trail`** — append-only event log. Satisfies auditability requirements.
4. **`lifecycle`** — review cadence, supersession chain, and archival. Prevents decision rot.
5. **`schema_version`** — pins each ADR to a specific schema version. Future-proofs the format.
6. **`architecturally_significant_requirements`** — embedded functional and non-functional ASRs with IDs.
7. **`dependencies`** — internal and external dependency tracking.

These are enterprise-grade extensions that should be preserved and documented as the **"Enterprise ADR extensions"** of this project.

### 7.2 Feature Adoption Tracker

#### ✅ Adopted

| Field | Source | Implementation |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| `extension_fields` (x-*) | smadr | Added via `patternProperties` at top level. Any `x-` prefixed field is accepted. |
| `summary` | NHS Wales | Added as optional string field (max 500 chars) in `adr` metadata. |
| `rejection_rationale` | Merson, DRF | Added as optional `rejection_rationale` field on each alternative. |

#### ❌ Not Adopted

| Field | Source | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| `related_principles` | Tyree–Akerman | Principles are already captured informally in `context.business_drivers`, `context.technical_drivers`, and `context.constraints`. Only Tyree–Akerman (the template most criticized for bureaucratic weight) has this. A dedicated field assumes a formal principles registry exists — external infrastructure we don't provide. Teams with registries can use `references` (URL to principles doc) or `x-related-principles` via extension fields. |
| `governance_enforcement` | Gareth Morgan | ADRs capture decisions; enforcement is downstream. Architecture should not point to code — code should point to architecture. Teams enforce decisions through their own mechanisms (CODEOWNERS, PR templates, fitness functions, CI policies). `confirmation` already captures implementation verification; ongoing enforcement is an operational concern. |
| `impact_assessment` | EdgeX Foundry | Impact is already captured across `dependencies.internal` (systems involved), `consequences.negative` (operational costs), and `decision.tradeoffs` (adaptation required). EdgeX's template targets change proposals for a specific codebase with enumerable services/DTOs — our ADRs describe architectural patterns where impacted systems vary by adopter. Teams needing this can use `x-impact-assessment`. |
| `risk_per_option` (3D) | smadr | smadr's Technical/Schedule/Ecosystem risk model is interesting but our per-option `risk` field combined with pros/cons provides equivalent coverage. |
| `neutral_consequences` | MADR 4.0 | Neutral consequences are rarely informative. Our positive/negative split is sufficient. |
| `decision_drivers` (unified list) | MADR / smadr | Our `business_drivers` + `technical_drivers` split is more informative than a flat list. |
| `swot_per_option` | Business Case | Overlaps with our pros/cons/cost/risk per alternative. SWOT is a management lens, not an engineering lens. |
| `context_validation` | DRF | DRF's organizational context graph (CRF) is architecturally novel but requires building a separate knowledge graph infrastructure. Worth revisiting when DRF matures past v0.1.0. |

### 7.3 What to Document

Our `confirmation`, `approvals`, `audit_trail`, and `lifecycle` fields are the **most novel contributions** of this schema compared to the broader ADR ecosystem. They should be explicitly documented as:

> **Enterprise ADR Extensions** — structured governance and lifecycle sections designed for regulated environments where decisions must be formally approved, auditable, and periodically reviewed. These are not part of any standard ADR template; they are custom extensions of the `adr-governance` meta-model.

This prevents future confusion about whether they come from a standard.

### 7.4 Removed: `risk_assessment`

> **Removed in v1.1.** The standalone `risk_assessment` section (structured risks with `id`, `likelihood`, `impact`, `mitigation`, `residual_risk`) was removed from the schema.

**Rationale:** A formal risk register with likelihood × impact matrices and mitigation lists is a threat model / ISMS artifact, not an ADR concern. Risks are already captured where they naturally belong in the existing schema:

- **`alternatives[].risk`** — overall risk level per alternative (low/medium/high/critical)
- **`alternatives[].cons`** — specific downsides and risks for each option
- **`consequences.negative`** — negative outcomes of the chosen decision
- **`decision.tradeoffs`** — what was sacrificed in the chosen approach
- **`context.constraints`** — hard boundaries

No other ADR template in the survey (§4) provides a standalone structured risk assessment section. The section added significant authoring burden without providing information that wasn't already expressible through the existing fields. If a formal risk register is needed, it should be a separate document linked via `references`.

## 9. Conclusion

Having surveyed **14 templates** (13 external + our own), we can now position `adr-governance` with much higher confidence. Our schema sits at the **maximum comprehensiveness** end of the ADR template spectrum. It is the only template that combines:

- MADR-style alternatives analysis with pros/cons
- Tyree–Akerman-style enterprise governance (assumptions, constraints, related artifacts)
- Confirmation with verification artifact IDs — inspired by MADR 4.0 / NHS Wales
- Formal approval workflow — **unique to us**
- Append-only audit trail — **unique to us**
- Lifecycle management (review cadence, supersession, archival) — **unique to us**
- Machine-readable YAML with JSON Schema validation

The expanded survey surfaced several features from other templates. Three were adopted (`summary`, `extension_fields`, `rejection_rationale`) and eight were explicitly not adopted after analysis. See §7.2 for the full adoption tracker with rationale.

The tradeoff remains **weight**: a full `adr-governance` ADR is significantly heavier than a Nygard or MADR record. This is acceptable for our use case (enterprise IAM decisions in regulated financial services) but would be overkill for a startup documenting database choices.

The closest philosophical neighbor is **DRF** (reasoning-first, machine-readable, validation-oriented), but it takes a fundamentally different architectural approach (two complementary specs vs. one unified schema) and is still in early draft (v0.1.0). Worth monitoring.

## 10. ADR Ecosystem Insights

The Henderson repository and related sources contain several important concepts beyond templates that are relevant to ADR governance:

### 10.1 Fitness Functions for Decisions as Code

**Fitness functions** are objective automated checks that verify decisions are being maintained. They make decisions testable and assurable.

- **Connection:** A decision record documents the decision; a fitness function *assures* the decision.
- **Example:** Decision = "We use event sourcing for audit requirements." Fitness function = CI test that all state changes produce events.
- **Tools:** [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/) (Java), [ArchUnitTS](https://github.com/LukasNiessen/ArchUnitTS) (TypeScript/JavaScript).
- **AI-assisted:** Henderson suggests using LLMs as fitness function evaluators, asking them to audit code/schemas against the decision log.
- **Relevance to us:** Our `confirmation` field (when added) could reference fitness functions. Our CI pipeline already validates ADR YAML — this is itself a fitness function.

### 10.2 Decision Guardian — PR-Level Enforcement

[Decision Guardian](https://github.com/DecispherHQ/decision-guardian) automatically surfaces relevant ADRs on pull requests when a developer modifies code covered by those decisions. Works with any CI system and as a pre-commit hook.

- **Relevance:** Addresses Gareth Morgan's "governance enforcement" question — decisions are surfaced *at the moment they're most likely to be violated*.
- **Action:** Evaluate for integration with our GitHub Actions CI pipeline.

### 10.3 Teamwork Advice (Henderson)

Key practical insights from teams using ADRs at scale:

1. **Name the directory `decisions/` not `adrs/`** — teams document more (vendor decisions, planning decisions, scheduling decisions) when the directory name uses plain language.
2. **Mutability works better than immutability in practice** — insert new info with date stamps rather than creating a new ADR for every update. "Living document" approach.
3. **Lead with "why" not "what"** — ADRs are not valuable if they're just after-the-fact paperwork.
4. **After-action reviews** — review each ADR one month later to compare the documented expectations with actual practice.

### 10.4 Related Formalisms

The Henderson repo references several pre-ADR decision documentation formalisms that influenced the field:

| Formalism | Full Name | Relevance |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **IBIS** | Issue-Based Information System | Question → Position → Argument structure. Influenced dialogue mapping. |
| **QOC** | Questions, Options, Criteria | Similar to ADR alternatives analysis. Academic predecessor. |
| **DRL** | Decision Representation Language | Formal decision trees. More rigorous than ADR prose. |
| **REMAP** | Representation and Maintenance of Process Knowledge | Process-oriented decision capture. |
| **DRF** | Decision Reasoning Format | Modern YAML/JSON successor. See Section 3.13. |

### 10.5 Company-Specific ADR Guidance

- **[AWS Prescriptive Guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/architectural-decision-records/adr-process.html):** Formal ADR process with lifecycle (Proposed → Review → Accepted/Rejected → Superseded). Recommends that ADRs are consulted during code and architectural reviews. Treats ADRs as immutable after acceptance.
- **[Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/architect-role/architecture-decision-record):** Positions ADRs as "one of the most important deliverables of a solution architect." Key advice: record **confidence level** per decision (low-confidence decisions get prioritized for reconsideration). Emphasizes **append-only** log and storing ADRs openly in the workload's documentation repository.
- **[RedHat](https://www.redhat.com/architect/architecture-decision-records):** Advocates ADRs for enterprise architects.
- **[GitHub ADR org](https://adr.github.io/):** Maintains MADR and the broader ADR standards ecosystem. Hosts the canonical template index and tooling list.

### 10.6 Architectural Decisions — The Making Of (Zimmermann)

[Olaf Zimmermann's comprehensive post](https://ozimmer.ch/practices/2020/04/27/ArchitectureDecisionMaking.html) provides a history of architecture decision recording since the late 1990s. Key insights:

1. **Y-Statements evolved from enterprise overengineering.** Zimmermann's earlier meta-models (IBM ARC-100, SOAD PhD project) were too heavy to maintain. The Y-statement was born from a sponsor saying: *"Can you fit each decision on one presentation slide?"*
2. **Good vs. bad justifications.** Good: "We performed a PoC and the results were convincing." Bad: "Everybody does it" or "Experience with this will look great on my resume."
3. **Don't overdo it.** "An AD log with more than 100 entries will probably put your readers (and you) to sleep." Focus on architecturally significant requirements only.
4. **Definition of Done for ADs.** Zimmermann proposes a [DoD for Architectural Decisions](https://ozimmer.ch/practices/2020/05/22/ADDefinitionOfDone.html) and an [Architectural Significance Test](https://ozimmer.ch/practices/2020/09/24/ASRTestECSADecisions.html).
- **Relevance to us:** Consider adding a **significance test checklist** to the ADR process — a quick filter to avoid trivial decisions getting full ADR treatment.

### 10.7 Skeptical Architecture (Cervantes & Woods)

[A Skeptic's Guide to Software Architecture Decisions](https://www.infoq.com/articles/architecture-skeptics-guide/) introduces **architectural skepticism** as a superpower:

1. **Every QAR is a hypothesis.** Quality Attribute Requirements (scalability, performance) are hypotheses about value, not facts. They must be tested empirically.
2. **Selective implementation for assumption testing.** Teams don't need to build the entire solution — build enough to run experiments that validate or refute assumptions.
3. **Skepticism breaks analysis paralysis.** If you accept that no decision can be proven right without experimentation, you short-circuit paralysis by identifying alternatives and testing them empirically.
4. **"When it comes to decisions about the solution, the only useful data comes from executing code; everything else is conjecture."**
- **Relevance to us:** Our `confirmation` field should explicitly support **experiment results** and **PoC outcomes** as artifact types, not just "code review" and "test suite."

### 10.8 Architectural Retrospectives (Cervantes & Woods)

[Architectural Retrospectives](https://www.infoq.com/articles/architectural-retrospectives/) are distinct from Architecture Reviews:

1. **Reviews improve the architecture; retrospectives improve the decision-making process.**
2. **Key retrospective questions:**
   - How were QARs established? Were they guesses or validated?
   - Was the whole team involved or did senior individuals dominate?
   - Have we ever reversed a decision based on new information?
   - Is technical debt growing, and is that acceptable?
3. **Should be separate from reviews** — team members won't discuss process problems with outsiders present.
4. **Frequency:** Every sprint/iteration. If there are no interesting answers, it's quick.
- **Relevance to us:** Consider adding a `reviewed` event type to `audit_trail` for periodic retrospective outcomes. Our `lifecycle.review_cycle_months` is the mechanism; retrospective questions could be documented in the process.

### 10.9 Microsoft Azure — Confidence Level

Azure's Well-Architected Framework uniquely recommends recording the **confidence level** of each decision:

> *"Sometimes an architecturally significant decision is made with relatively low confidence. Documenting that low confidence status could prove useful for future reconsideration decisions."*

- **Relevance to us:** A `confidence` field (e.g., `low`, `medium`, `high`) on the `decision` object would flag decisions that deserve early re-evaluation. Low-confidence decisions could trigger shorter `lifecycle.review_cycle_months`.

## 11. Proposals: Improvements Derived from Henderson Research

After going through all the links from the [Henderson ADR repository](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record), the following are concrete proposals for improving our `adr-governance` schema and process. Organized by priority.

### 11.1 🟢 Proposal: Add `confidence` Field to `decision` Object

**Source:** [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/architect-role/architecture-decision-record)

**What:** Add an optional `confidence` field (`low`, `medium`, `high`) to the `decision` object.

**Why:** Azure uniquely recommends recording the confidence level of each decision. A decision made with low confidence under time pressure should be flagged for early re-evaluation. This naturally interacts with `lifecycle.review_cycle_months` — low-confidence decisions could default to shorter review cycles.

**Schema change:**
```json
"confidence": {
    "type": "string",
    "enum": ["low", "medium", "high"],
    "description": "Confidence level in this decision. Low-confidence decisions should have shorter review cycles."
}
```

**Impact:** Low. Additive. Improves decision quality signaling.

---

### 11.2 🟢 Proposal: Add `reviewed` Event to `audit_trail`

**Source:** [Architectural Retrospectives (Cervantes & Woods)](https://www.infoq.com/articles/architectural-retrospectives/), Henderson Section 10.3 (After-Action Reviews)

**What:** Add `reviewed` to the `audit_trail` `event` enum.

**Why:** Our `lifecycle.review_cycle_months` triggers periodic reviews, but there's currently no way to record that a review *happened* and what the outcome was. The `reviewed` event closes this gap. It should capture: "We reviewed ADR-0001 on 2026-06-05. Decision remains valid. Context unchanged."

Henderson specifically advises: *"Review each ADR one month later to compare the documented expectations with actual practice."*

**Schema change:** Add `"reviewed"` to the `audit_trail.event` enum.

**Impact:** Low. Single enum value. Completes the review lifecycle.

---

### 11.3 ❌ Proposal: Decision Guardian Integration — Rejected

**Source:** [Decision Guardian](https://github.com/DecispherHQ/decision-guardian), Henderson Section 10.2

**What:** Integrate Decision Guardian as a GitHub Action that auto-surfaces relevant ADRs when PRs modify code covered by accepted decisions.

**Rejected (2026-03-06).** Three reasons:

1. **Wrong direction of coupling.** Decision Guardian maps *from* decisions *to* code paths. This inverts the correct dependency: architecture should not point to code — code should point to architecture. The ADR is a portable, organization-agnostic decision record. File paths are codebase-specific implementation details. Binding them together creates a dual registry (ADR YAML + `.decispher/decisions.md`) and couples the decision layer to the implementation layer.

2. **Enforcement is downstream, not upstream.** ADRs capture decisions. Teams that depend on those decisions are responsible for enforcing them through their own tooling: CODEOWNERS, PR templates, ArchUnit fitness functions, CI policies, code review checklists. Those mechanisms vary by organization and codebase — they don't belong in the governance framework.

3. **Maturity risk.** Decision Guardian has 26 stars, a single maintainer, and 2 releases. Recommending it as part of an enterprise governance framework contradicts the framework's own posture on supply chain risk.

**What we do instead:** Document enforcement as a downstream responsibility in `adr-process.md`. Recommend PR templates with ADR compliance checklists as a lightweight, platform-native approach.

---

### 11.4 🟡 Proposal: Add Architectural Significance Test

**Source:** [Zimmermann — Architectural Significance Test](https://ozimmer.ch/practices/2020/09/24/ASRTestECSADecisions.html), [Definition of Done for ADs](https://ozimmer.ch/practices/2020/05/22/ADDefinitionOfDone.html)

**What:** Add a lightweight significance checklist to `adr-process.md` that helps authors decide whether something warrants a full ADR.

**Why:** Zimmermann warns: *"An AD log with more than 100 entries will probably put your readers to sleep."* Not every technical decision needs an ADR. The significance test prevents ADR inflation.

**Suggested checklist (add to Section 3 of `adr-process.md`):**

> **Before writing an ADR, verify at least ONE of these applies:**
> 1. The decision affects multiple components, teams, or services
> 2. The decision is difficult/expensive to reverse
> 3. The decision has security, compliance, or regulatory implications
> 4. The decision establishes a pattern that others will follow
> 5. The decision involves a tradeoff between quality attributes (e.g., security vs. usability)
> 6. Someone will ask "why did we do this?" in 6 months

**Impact:** Process-only (no schema change). Prevents ADR overload.

---

### 11.5 🟡 Proposal: Add Architectural Retrospective Questions

**Source:** [Architectural Retrospectives (Cervantes & Woods)](https://www.infoq.com/articles/architectural-retrospectives/)

**What:** Add a section to `adr-process.md` defining retrospective questions to ask during periodic ADR reviews.

**Why:** Cervantes & Woods distinguish between *architecture reviews* ("is the architecture correct?") and *architecture retrospectives* ("are we making decisions well?"). Our `lifecycle.review_cycle_months` triggers the review. The retrospective questions guide what to examine.

**Suggested questions for periodic ADR review:**

1. Did the consequences we predicted actually occur?
2. Were there unforeseen consequences we should document?
3. Has the context changed since this decision was made?
4. Was the confidence level of this decision appropriate? (ties to Proposal 11.1)
5. Have we accumulated technical debt from this decision?
6. Is this decision still the right choice given what we now know?
7. Should we trigger a superseding ADR?

**Impact:** Process-only (no schema change). Improves review quality.

---

### 11.6 🟡 Proposal: Support Experiment/PoC Results as Confirmation Artifacts

**Source:** [Skeptic's Guide (Cervantes & Woods)](https://www.infoq.com/articles/architecture-skeptics-guide/), [Zimmermann (Good Justifications)](https://ozimmer.ch/practices/2020/04/27/ArchitectureDecisionMaking.html)

**What:** Expand guidance for the `confirmation` field to explicitly include experiment results, PoC outcomes, and performance benchmarks as verification artifacts.

**Why:** Both the Skeptic's Guide and Zimmermann emphasize that the strongest decision justifications come from empirical evidence (PoCs, PoTs, benchmarks), not from authority or convention. Our `confirmation.artifact_ids` already supports arbitrary strings, but we should document recommended artifact types.

**Documentation change (add to `confirmation` description in glossary or schema):**

> Recommended artifact types for `confirmation.artifact_ids`:
> - Jira/GitHub issues: `JIRA-1234`, `https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42`
> - Pull requests: `https://github.com/org/repo/pull/142`
> - Test suites: `TEST-SUITE-auth-dpop-e2e`
> - ArchUnit/fitness functions: `archunit:no-direct-db-access`
> - PoC/Experiment results: `POC-2026-03-dpop-latency-benchmark`
> - Performance benchmarks: `BENCH-jwt-signing-ed25519-vs-rsa`
> - Sprint review notes: `SPRINT-42-review-notes`

**Impact:** Documentation-only. Encourages empirical confirmation.

---

### 11.7 ⚪ Proposal: Monitor DRF (Decision Reasoning Format) Maturity

**Source:** [Reasoning Formats](https://github.com/reasoning-formats/reasoning-formats)

**What:** Keep watching DRF as it matures past v0.1.0. DRF's CRF (Context Reasoning Format) is the closest thing to an organizational policy graph that could validate decisions against existing policies.

**Why:** DRF's killer feature is `context_validation` — a decision can reference organizational policies and automatically surface conflicts (e.g., "this decision conflicts with the Kubernetes Moratorium policy"). This is advisory, not blocking. If DRF stabilizes, it could become a companion to our schema.

**Impact:** No immediate action. Watch-list item.
